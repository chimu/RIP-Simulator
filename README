--- RIP Simulator ---

    - Running -

      For each RIP router you wish to simulate, create a new terminal window and run

	    ./ripsim.py <routerfile>
	    
      For example to simulate the router described in christchurch.cfg:

	    ./ripsim.py nzrouters/christchurch.cfg
      
      
    - Configuration format -
    
     The configuration file must begin with the header [RIP]
     The following options are mandatory:
	    router-id: The Router id of the suimulated router
	    input-ports: A comma delimited list of ports the router listens on
	    output-ports: A comma delimited list of routers the router sends to, in the format
			  <dest_port-dest_router_id-link_metric> for example '4003-2-1, 4010-5-1' 
	    update-interval: The period in seconds between the sending of update packets
	    neighbour-timeout: The time in seconds since the last received packet from a neighbour
			       after which the neighbour is assumed to be down
			       
			       
      For example:
	    
	    [RIP]
	    router-id: 1
	    input-ports: 4001, 4002
	    output-ports: 4003-2-1, 4010-5-1 
	    update-interval: 30
	    neighbour-timeout: 180
